  <p>
    <strong>"Ouch!"</strong> cried the newborn nebula, or at least it would have sounded like "ouch" to human ears. Of course there had been no humans for several hundred thousand... "what was that word again" NewNeb pulsated to itself..
    <ol>
      <li>Century?</li>
      <li>Decade</li>
      <li>second?</li>
    </ol> 
    It really was quite difficult to recall all those sounds made so many <em>millennia</em> ago by those perfectly strange flesh bags. "OH! That's it! Millennia!"

    NewNeb really was quite pleased with itself, if one could thing of NewNeb as an itself, which of course one CANNOT! NewNeb is more of a...
    <ul>
      <li>energetic quarantine</li>
      <li>cacophony of molecules</li>
    </ul>
    ...and the like. NewNeb began pulsating in a bit of a dark direction and so decided to access some of the flesh bag archives to distract. "Lets look at the cat themed ones today!"
