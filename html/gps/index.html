<!--What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Semantic tags give meaning to the various sections and content within a given html5 page and encourage standardization across the dev community. Which ones do you see as most useful? The <nav> tag seems to be the most obviously useful since it's content is pretty clear. Tags like <article> & <section> seem like they could be used interchangeably in certain situations.-->
<!--What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?The order you place them in, however since semantic tags carry meaning, as a developer we shold consider this when ordering them. A good example would be: header, nav, main, section, article, aside, footer.-->
<!--What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? I learned how to define snippets and while I think they can be very powerful as my use cases become more specific I will likely not have much use for customization in the near term. Currently I am trying to learn how to be a wiz with the Emmet package.-->
<!--What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept? Keeping track of which tags should have colspan/rowspan applied to them required the most brain energy but once my pair and I drew it out it was easier. Practice practice, practice.-->
