# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
    * Version control is the ability to create, store and access multiple instances of the same set of files. This is useful because it allows us to edit our code without the risk of destroying everything because you can always revert. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
    * A branch is a version/instance of a git repository that can be used to make and commit changes to code without impacting the original project files until they are ready to be safely merged. This is especially important when collaborating with multiple developers on a single project so as to avoid irrevocably damaging something.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
    * A commit is a way to add files to a given branch. A good commit message clearly state the changes made to a given file while maintaining brevity.  
* What is a merge conflict?
    * A merge conflict is a discrepancy between the commits of two or more branches. 
* Adding an arbitrary change
